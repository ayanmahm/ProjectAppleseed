# 2022 CS Project (Codename Appleseed)

For my project this year, I decided to develop a Python applet which would allow a student or teacher to sign up to a service designed to help students find courses and internships they could attend, or other select extra-curricular activities which they may choose to attend, such as plays, open days, etc.
### Main intended functions:
* A graphical user interface, which includes accessibility tools designed to make the software usable with a screen-reader etc.
* A student or teacher would be able to sign up through the app
* The app allows any user to send a course to another with the direct message feature.
* The app shows some details about each course, such as a description and deadlines to apply.
* The app allows a student to upload their university choices.
* The app allows a student to add or delete an entry of their grade progress
* The app allows a student to see their grade history on a graph.
* The app allows a user to change their password, or course of choice.
* The app allows a user to delete their account, with of their data being erased from the database.

### Some small disclaimers
* This code makes references to a database. Some of the sensitive details pertaining to it have been omitted.
* There are instances in some file where there are prints to the terminal for testing purposes which have not been omitted.
* The fonts used in this project are open source, or system fonts when these fail to load or render.
* Some of the `import` statements and some formatting in this code may not make sense, due to some issues with the IDE I was using for this project.
